# Earwig_aggregation

A quick workflow to performed the analyses used to investigate the individual aggregation variation in the European earwig adult 
female *Forficula auricularia*. Here we report both methods and results in plain text and R code through R scripts, Markdown and an 
interactive HTML file.

The main purpose of the project is to understand the role of the microbiota in the facultative species the European earwig *F.auricularia*.
Among the many effects of gut microbes on their hosts, a recent hypothesis suggests that they may promote social evolution: by increasing 
the host's social interactions, they could increase their own transmission to new hosts. While this hypothesis has been addressed in some 
theoretical work, it remains untested empirically. Here, we addressed this knowledge gap using the European earwig, an insect that naturally 
exhibits both solitary and social life.

NB : The supplemental files will be available upon the publication of the current manuscript.
